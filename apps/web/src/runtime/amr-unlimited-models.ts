 * through the `coding_plan` billing mode, constrained to
 * `membership_tier_snapshot = ANY (ARRAY['go','plus','pro','max'])`, so a Team
 * workspace never produces a zero-charge call. `team_basic` is seats-only on
 * top of that (`monthly_credits_per_seat = 0` in the seeded catalog).
 *

 * matching is what made an earlier plan rule answer `plus` for "Team Plus",
